# GitHub Practice Document

We are going to practice two things at once! The example below shows you how to add labels to plots.

### Example

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Fuel efficiency generally decreases with engine size",
    subtitle = "Two seaters (sports cars) are an exception because of their light weight",
    caption = "Data from fueleconomy.gov",
    x = "Engine displacement (L)",
    y = "Highway fuel economy (mpg)",
    color = "Car type"
  )
```

## Your Turn!

Pick an exploratory graphic you have created since the start of the practicum and paste the code below. Add labels to your graph to make it more understandable for others.
